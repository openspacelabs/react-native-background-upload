# react-native-background-upload

OpenSpace home-grown background uploader for React Native. on iOS it uses URLSession, on Android it uses CoroutineWorker and Ktor.

Documentation has been modified to reflect the changes made to this library.

# Installation

## 1. Install package

`yarn add react-native-background-upload`

Note: if you are installing on React Native < 0.47, use `react-native-background-upload@3.0.0` instead of `react-native-background-upload`

## 2. Link Native Code

### Autolinking (React Native >= 0.60)

##### iOS

`cd ./ios && pod install && cd ../`

## 3. Expo

To use this library with [Expo](https://expo.io) one must first detach (eject) the project and follow [step 2](#2-link-native-code) instructions. Additionally on iOS there is a must to add a Header Search Path to other dependencies which are managed using Pods. To do so one has to add `$(SRCROOT)/../../../ios/Pods/Headers/Public` to Header Search Path in `VydiaRNFileUploader` module using XCode.

# Usage

```js
import Upload from 'react-native-background-upload';

const options = {
  url: 'https://myservice.com/path/to/post',
  path: 'file://path/to/file/on/device',
  method: 'POST',
  type: 'raw',
  headers: {
    'content-type': 'application/octet-stream', // Customize content-type
    'my-custom-header': 's3headervalueorwhateveryouneed',
  },
  android: {
    notificationChannel: 'my-channel-id',
    notificationId: 'my-progress-notification',
    notificationTitle: 'Uploading...',
  },
  useUtf8Charset: true,
};

Upload.addListener('progress', uploadId, (data) => {
  console.log(`Progress: ${data.progress}%`);
});
Upload.addListener('error', uploadId, (data) => {
  console.log(`Error: ${data.error}%`);
});
Upload.addListener('cancelled', uploadId, (data) => {
  console.log(`Cancelled!`);
});
Upload.addListener('completed', uploadId, (data) => {
  // data includes responseCode: number and responseBody: Object
  console.log('Completed!');
});
Upload.android.addNotificationListener(() => {
  console.log('Progress notification pressed!');
});

Upload.startUpload(options)
  .then((uploadId) => console.log('Upload started', uploadId))
  .catch((err) => console.log('Upload error!', err));
```

## Multipart Uploads

**ðŸš§ COMING SOON**

Just set the `type` option to `multipart` and set the `field` option. Example:

```
const options = {
  url: 'https://myservice.com/path/to/post',
  path: 'file://path/to/file%20on%20device.png',
  method: 'POST',
  field: 'uploaded_media',
  type: 'multipart'
}
```

Note the `field` property is required for multipart uploads.

# API

## Top Level Functions

All top-level methods are available as named exports or methods on the default export.

### startUpload(options)

The primary method you will use, this starts the upload process.

Returns a promise with the string ID of the upload. Will reject if there is a connection problem, the file doesn't exist, or there is some other problem.

`options` is an object with following values:

_Note: You must provide valid URIs. react-native-background-upload does not escape the values you provide._

### Notification Object (Android Only)

Android forces us to display a progress notification to show overall upload progress.

| Name                  | Type   | Required | Description                       | Example                     |
| --------------------- | ------ | -------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `notificationChannel` | string | Optional | Sets android notification channel | `background-upload-channel` |
| `notificationId`      | string | Optional | A custom ID for the notification  | `upload-progress`           |
| `notificationTitle`   | string | Optional | Sets a title for the notification | `Uploading...`              |

### cancelUpload(uploadId)

Cancels an upload.

`uploadId` is the result of the Promise returned from `startUpload`

Returns a Promise that resolves to an boolean indicating whether the upload was cancelled.

### addListener(eventType, uploadId, listener)

Adds an event listener, possibly confined to a single upload.

`eventType` Event to listen for. Values: 'progress' | 'error' | 'completed' | 'cancelled'

`uploadId` The upload ID from `startUpload` to filter events for. If null, this will include all uploads.

`listener` Function to call when the event occurs.

Returns an [EventSubscription](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/Libraries/vendor/emitter/EmitterSubscription.js). To remove the listener, call `remove()` on the `EventSubscription`.

### android.addNotificationListener(listener)

When the upload progress notification is pressed, it will open the app and fire this event.
There's no event data for this.

# FAQs

Does it support iOS camera roll assets?

> Yes, as of version 4.3.0.

Does it support multiple file uploads?

> Yes and No. It supports multiple concurrent uploads, but only a single upload per request. That should be fine for 90%+ of cases.

Why should I use this file uploader instead of others that I've Googled like [react-native-uploader](https://github.com/aroth/react-native-uploader)?

> This package has two killer features not found anywhere else (as of 12/16/2016). First, it works on both iOS and Android. Others are iOS only. Second, it supports background uploading. This means that users can background your app and the upload will continue. This does not happen with other uploaders.
